## Building

Recommendations on environment:

- Recommended version of Node.js: LTS (20)

First you need to clone the repository and install all packages:

```shell
npm install --save-dev
```

Second, you need to run the `build` command. It will first build the popup using SvelteKit and then build all the 
content scripts/stylesheets and copy the manifest afterward.

Extension can currently be built for 2 different imageboards using one of the following commands:

```shell
# To build the extension for Furbooru, use:
npm run build

# To build the extension for Derpbooru, use:
npm run build:derpibooru
```

When build is complete, extension  files can be found in the `/build` directory. These files can be either used 
directly in Chrome (via loading the extension as unpacked extension) or manually compressed into `*.zip` file and loaded
into Firefox.
